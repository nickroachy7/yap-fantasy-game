-- The clash message has to name a PLACE, and "Week 4" is not one.
--
-- `set_lineup`'s exclusivity refusal exists to say WHICH contest is holding the
-- card — that is the entire difference between it and the trigger backstop,
-- which can only say that something is. It named `contests.name`, and for the
-- free contest that is the week:
--
--     already playing elsewhere this week: Ja'Marr Chase (in Week 4)
--
-- Every word of which is true and none of which helps. The reader is TRYING to
-- play him in week 4; being told he is already in "Week 4" reads as the game
-- contradicting itself, and there is no screen called that to go and fix it.
--
-- Caught by `contests.test.sql` asserting the message rather than the errcode.
-- The assertion was written expecting the wrong contest to be named and the
-- real answer — the one HOLDING the card, which is right — is what exposed how
-- it reads.
--
-- A free contest keeps its week for a name, because that is what a heading
-- wants; this is the one place it has to be said mid-sentence instead.
